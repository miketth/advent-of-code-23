# Advent of Code '23 solutions

Welcome to my AoC '23 repo!
I aim to solve each challenge in a different language.
I don't claim to be an expert of any of these languages, I don't guarantee that any of the solutions is going to be
idiomatic, clean or representative of what that given language can be.
This is more of a challenge to myself, and maybe I can inspire people along the way.
